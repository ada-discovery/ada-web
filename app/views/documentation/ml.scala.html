            Ada offers advanced machine learning functionality backed by <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html">Spark ML library</a>, which
            is a popular compute grid library for an efficient large-scale data processing and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spark has been developed in Scala, and so it pairs well with functional programming. Nevertheless, Java, Python, and R adapters are available too.
            Besides scalability and a community support, one of the superior features compared to other compute/ML platforms, is that the libraries or class binaries
            that implement the tasks to be executed are streamed to compute nodes if not available locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            From Spark, Ada integrated several classification (e.g., random forest), regression (e.g., gradient boost regression tree), and clustering routines (e.g., bisecting k-means)
            with a wide range of evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUROC, AUPR, R2, RNMSE, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>
            On the top of that, ML results can be saved, queried, and visualized, and even exported to a (new) data set directly in Ada.
